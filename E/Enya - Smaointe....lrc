[03:51.00]Listen to my heart.
[03:58.00]So sad forever;
[04:05.00]I am lost without you
[04:12.00]And your wife,
[04:19.00]The great love in your life.
[04:26.00]She guided me.
[04:33.00]Both of you, be with me always,
[04:40.00]Day and night.
[04:47.00]I cry at the great loneliness
[04:54.00]Tears, so sad,
[05:01.00]And you sleeping in the quiet, green grave
[05:08.00]In deep peace.
[05:15.00]There was happiness,
[05:22.00]But it went away.
[05:29.00]You followed your husband,
[05:36.00]The great love in your life.
[05:43.00]He guided me.
[05:50.00]Both of you, be with me always,
[05:57.00]Day and night.
[06:04.00]I cry at the great loneliness
[06:11.00]Tears, so sad,
[06:18.00]And you sleeping in the quiet, green grave
[06:25.00]In deep peace.
[06:32.00]I think of the day
[06:39.00]That you were at my side
[06:46.00]Telling stories
[06:53.00]Of the days that were.
[07:00.00]I remember the day,
[07:07.00]Without want and without gloom.
[07:14.00]Both of you, be with me always,
[07:21.00]Day and night.
