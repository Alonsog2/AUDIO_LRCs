[00:00.00](Lead vocal - Chris Rainbow)
[00:08.00]    Watching, waiting, rising, falling.
[00:16.00]    Listening, calling, drifting.
[00:24.00]    Touching, feeling, seeing, believing.
[00:32.00]    Hoping, sending, leaving.
[00:40.00]    I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
[00:48.00]    If I tried to write a million words a day
[00:56.00]    I see your shadow coming closer
[01:04.00]    Then watch you drifting away.
[01:12.00]    Watching, waiting, rising, falling.
[01:20.00]    Listening, calling, drifting.
[01:28.00]    Touching, feeling, seeing, believing.
[01:36.00]    Hoping, sending, leaving.
[01:44.00]    I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
[01:52.00]    We are travelling a million worlds away
[02:00.00]    I see your shadow coming closer
[02:08.00]    Then watch you drifting away.
