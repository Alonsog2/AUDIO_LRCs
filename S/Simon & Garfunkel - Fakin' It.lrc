[00:00.00]When she goes, sheâ€™s gone.
[00:05.00]If she stays, she stays here.
[00:10.00]The girl does what she wants to do.
[00:15.00]She knows what she wants to do.
[00:20.00]And I know Iâ€™m fakinâ€™ it,
[00:25.00]Iâ€™m not really makinâ€™ it.
[00:30.00]Iâ€™m such a dubious soul,
[00:35.00]And a walk in the garden
[00:40.00]Wears me down.
[00:45.00]Tangled in the fallen vines,
[00:50.00]Pickinâ€™ up the punch lines,
[00:55.00]Iâ€™ve just been fakinâ€™ it,
[01:00.00]Not really makinâ€™ it.
[01:05.00]Is there any danger?
[01:10.00]No, no, not really.
[01:15.00]Just lean on me.
[01:20.00]Takinâ€™ time to treat
[01:25.00]Your friendly neighbors honestly.
[01:30.00]Iâ€™ve just been fakinâ€™ it,
[01:35.00]Iâ€™m not really makinâ€™ it.
[01:40.00]This feeling of fakinâ€™ it â€“
[01:45.00]I still havenâ€™t shaken it.
[01:50.00]Prior to this lifetime
[01:55.00]I surely was a tailor...look at me.
[02:00.00](â€œGood morning, Mr. Leitch.
[02:05.00]Have you had a busy day?â€)
[02:10.00]I own the tailorâ€™s face and hands.
[02:15.00]I am the tailorâ€™s face and hands and
[02:20.00]I know Iâ€™m fakinâ€™ it,
[02:25.00]Iâ€™m not really makinâ€™ it.
[02:30.00]This feeling of fakinâ€™ it â€“
[02:35.00]I still havenâ€™t shaken it.
