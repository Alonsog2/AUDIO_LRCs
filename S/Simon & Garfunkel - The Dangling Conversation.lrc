[al:The Best of Simon & Garfunkel]
[00:00.00]It's a still-life watercolor
[00:04.00]of a now late afternoon
[00:08.00]As the sun shines through the curtain lace,
[00:12.00]and shadows wash the room
[00:16.00]And we sit and drink our coffee,
[00:20.00]couched in our indifference
[00:24.00]Like shells upon the shore,
[00:28.00]you can hear the ocean roar
[00:32.00]In the dangling conversation
[00:36.00]And the superficial sighs
[00:40.00]The borders of our lives
[00:44.00]And you read your Emily Dickinson,
[00:48.00]and I my Robert Frost
[00:52.00]And we note our place with bookmarkers
[00:56.00]that measure what we've lost
[01:00.00]Like a poem poorly written,
[01:04.00]we are verses out of rhythm
[01:08.00]Couplets out of rhyme,
[01:12.00]in syncopated time.
[01:16.00]In the dangling conversation
[01:20.00]And the superficial sighs
[01:24.00]Are the borders of our lives
[01:28.00]Yes we speak of things that matter
[01:32.00]with words that must be said
[01:36.00]"Can analysis be worthwhile?"
[01:40.00]"Is the theatre really dead?"
[01:44.00]And now the room has softly faded,
[01:48.00]and I only kiss your shadow
[01:52.00]I cannot feel your hand,
[01:56.00]you're a stranger now unto me
[02:00.00]Lost in the dangling conversation
[02:04.00]And the superficial sighs
[02:08.00]In the borders of our lives
