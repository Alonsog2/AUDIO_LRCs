[00:00.00]  (Intro: C  /B  Am  (x2) ) 
[00:05.00]          C                 Am  
<<<<<<< HEAD
[00:07.24]Now I've heard there was a secret chord
[00:09.80]      C                     Am  
[00:10.00]That David played, and it pleased the Lord
[00:13.18]     F                G              C       G  
[00:13.38]But you don't really care for music, do you?
[00:18.00]    C                  F           G  
[00:20.01]It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
[00:23.53]     Am              F  
[00:23.73]The minor fall, the major lift
[00:26.45]     G               E/G#       Am  
[00:26.81]The baffled king composing Hallelujah
[00:31.36]      F           Am          F         C G C    G  
[00:32.88]Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[00:49.87]
[00:50.07]Your faith was strong but you needed proof
[00:53.98]You saw her bathing on the roof
[00:56.61]Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
[01:03.24]She tied you to a kitchen chair
[01:06.75]She broke your throne, she cut your hair
[01:10.11]And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
[01:16.40]Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
[01:31.90]
[01:33.32]Maybe I’ve been here before
[01:36.80]I know this room, I’ve walked this floor
[01:40.10]I used to live alone before I knew you
[01:46.52]I’ve seen your flag on the Marble Arch
[01:50.04]Love is not a victory march
[01:53.50]It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
[01:59.54]Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
[02:14.85]
[02:16.66]There was a time you let me know
[02:19.69]What’s real and going on below
[02:23.41]But now you never show it to me, do you
[02:29.68]And remember when I moved in you
[02:33.57]The holy dark was moving too
[02:36.62]And every breath we drew was hallelujah
[02:42.74]Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
[02:58.42]
[03:00.34]Maybe there’s a God above
[03:04.70]And all I ever learned from love
[03:07.01]Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
[03:13.41]And it’s not a cry you can hear at night
[03:16.81]It’s not somebody who’s seen the light
[03:19.86]It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
[03:25.95]Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
[03:39.49]Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
