[al:Esta Noche Cruzamos El Mississ]
[00:00.00]We all came out to Montreaux
[00:10.00]On the lake Geneva shoreline
[00:20.00]To make records with a mobile
[00:30.00]We didn't have much time
[00:40.00]Frank Zappa and the mothers
[00:50.00]Were at the best place around
[01:00.00]But some stupid with a flare gun
[01:10.00]Burned the place to the ground
[01:20.00]Smoke on the water
[01:30.00]Fire in the sky
[01:40.00]Smoke on the water
[01:50.00]They burned down the gambling house
[02:00.00]It died with an awful sound
[02:10.00]Funky claude was running in and out
[02:20.00]Pulling kids out the ground
[02:30.00]When it all was over
[02:40.00]We had to find another place
[02:50.00]But Swiss time was running out
[03:00.00]It seemed that we would lose the race
[03:10.00]Smoke on the water
[03:20.00]Fire in the sky
[03:30.00]Smoke on the water
[03:40.00]We ended up at the "Grand Hotel"
[03:50.00]It was empty, cold, and bare
[04:00.00]But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
[04:10.00]Making our music there
[04:20.00]With a few red lights and a few old beds
[04:30.00]We made the place to sweat
[04:40.00]No matter what we get out of this
[04:50.00]I know
[05:00.00]I know we'll never forget
[05:10.00]Smoke on the water
[05:20.00]Fire in the sky
[05:30.00]Smoke on the water
