E   
You keep saying, you've got something for me,
Something you call love, but confess
A   
You've been messing where you shouldnt be messing, 
E   
And now someone else is getting all your best.
G                   Em    
These Boots are made for walking
G                       Em    
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       Em     
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you. 
(E E D# D# D D C# C# C C B B A# A# A G)
You keep lying when you ought to be truthing,
And you keep losing when you ought to not bet,
You keep sameing when you ought to be -a- changing,
Now what's rights right but you aint been right yet.
These Boots are made for walking...
You keep playing where you shouldnt be playing, and you keep thinking
that you'll never get burned , ha!
I just found me a brand new box of matches yeah
And what he knows you aint had time to learn.
These Boots are made for walking...
Are you ready boots, start walking....
