(verses)
C                Dm
Yeah, once upon a time you dressed so fine
Em                    F              G          G7
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
C                Dm
People'd call, say, "beware doll,
Em                         F                 G                 G F# F
You're bound to fall" you thought they were all ...kiddin' you!

(pre-chorus)
F             G
You used to - laugh about
F                  G
Everybody that was hangin' out
F       Em    Dm      C
Now you don't talk so loud
F       Em    Dm      C
Now you don't seem so proud


Dm                            F             G7
About having to be scrounging for your next meal!

(chorus)
C    F   G  (G7)
How does it feel...?
C    F   G  (G7)
How does it feel...?
C    F   G  (G7)
With no direction, home...?
C    F   G  (G7)
Like a complete unknown...?
C    F   G  (G7)
Just like a rolling  stone?

(verse)
C                          Dm
You've gone to the finest school all right, "miss lonely"
Em            F          G         G7
But you know you only used to get juiced in it!
C                           Dm
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Em                F                 G                G F# F
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it

(pre-chorus)
F                     G
You said you'd never compromise
F                     G
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
F     Em    Dm       C
He's not selling any alibis
F     Em    Dm       C
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Dm               F            G7
And ask him do you want to make a deal?

(chorus)
C   F  G
How does it feel...?
C   F  G
How does it feel...?
C   F  G
With no direction home...?
C   F  G
Like a complete unknown...?
C   F  G
Just like a rolling  stone?

(chorus)
C  F  G
How does it feel...?
C  F  G
How does it feel...?
C  F  G
With no direction home...?
C  F  G
Like a complete unknown...?
C  F  G
Just like a rolling  stone?

(verses)
C                Dm            Em
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
F            G             G7
Theyre drinkin, thinkin that they got it made
C                 Dm            Em
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
F                G               G7                         G F# F
But youd better lift your diamond ring, youd better pawn it babe

(pre-chorus)
F                G
You used to be so amused
F                           G
At napoleon in rags and the language that he used
F       Em       Dm          C
Go to him now, he calls you, you cant refuse
F       Em         Dm          C
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
Dm                 F                G
Youre invisible now!, you got no secrets - to conceal...

(chorus)
C  F G
How does it feel...?
C  F G
How does it feel...?
C  F G
With no direction home...?
C  F G
Like a complete unknown...?
C  F G
Just like a rolling  stone?
