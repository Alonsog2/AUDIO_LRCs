[00:00.00]Iâ€™ll never understand why
[00:09.00]your voice is so related to my mind
[00:18.00]â€œWrongâ€ itâ€™s not in your noise
[00:27.00]Hidden feelings on the top of the roof
[00:36.00]And itâ€™s unreachable, and illogical
[00:45.00]Blocking my mind, blocking my mind, blocking my mind

[01:03.00]Oh Oh, Iâ€™m driving on a motorway
[01:12.00]Chaos is the name of the road
[01:21.00]Hey, and Iâ€™m following the signs of the road
[01:30.00]Because I canâ€™t go on on my own, I canâ€™t go on on my own
[01:39.00]Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
[01:48.00]And I am working on building up a wall in my heart
[01:57.00]So little soldiers of war donâ€™t try to climb it up
[02:06.00]And I am working on building up a railing in my mind
[02:15.00]So before getting in
[02:24.00]you must knock on me,
[02:33.00]You must knock on me,
[02:42.00]you must knock on me
[02:51.00](estribillo)
[03:00.00]Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
[03:09.00]Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
