[ti:Parisienne Walkway]
[al:Ballads & Blues]
[00:00.00]I remember Paris 1949,
[00:41.00]The Champs Elysee, San Michelle,
[01:22.00]And old Beaujolais wine.
[02:03.00]And I recall that you were mine
[02:44.00]In those Parisienne days.
[03:25.00]Looking back at the photographs,
[04:06.00]Those summer days spent outside corner cafes.
[04:47.00]Oh, I could write you paragraphs
[05:28.00]About my old Parisienne days.
